            <strong>Note that these components are installed by default; if you select Component | Install Packages in the IDE,
		you'll see C++Builder Sample Components Package in the package list. If you click the package, you'll see it's
		associated with dclbcbsmp170.bpl, which this project will build. If you click the Components button, you'll
		see which components this package adds to the palette:

			TCTrayIcon
			TPerformanceGraph
			TCSpinButton
			TCSpinEdit
			TCColorGrid
			TCGauge
			TCDirectoryOutline
			TCCalendar
			TPie

 		Be sure to select uninstall from the local menu of the bpl node in the project manager before building this project.
		To install the components, first select the runtime package bcbsmp170.bpl in the Project Manager, then select Make 
		from the local menu. When compiling is done, select dclbcbsmp170.bpl, then the Install local menu item,
		and you'll see after compiling is finished a confirmation dialog showing the design components having been
		installed.
